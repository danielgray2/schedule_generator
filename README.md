# schedule_generator

## To get up and running
- Install Docker on your computer. If you are on Mac, see [this link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/). If you are on Windows,
  see [this link](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install-windows-home/). If you are on Linux, look up how to install it for your
  distribution.
- Install npm on your computer. If you are on mac, see [this link](https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html). If you are on Linux, install it via your package manager.
- Install make on your computer. If you are on mac, I think that you have to have XCode, and if you do, you should be good to go. If not, see [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10265742/how-to-install-make-and-gcc-on-a-mac).
